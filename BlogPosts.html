            <h2>What is Responsive Web Design?</h2>
            <p>
                Responsive web design is an approach to web development that aims to make web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. The core idea is to create a flexible and adaptable layout and user interface that responds to the user's screen, providing an optimal viewing and interaction experience.
            </p>
    
            <h2>Principles of Responsive Web Design</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fluid Grid Layouts</strong>
                    <p>One of the fundamental principles of responsive design is the use of fluid grid layouts. Instead of fixed pixel measurements, use relative units like percentages for defining widths and heights. This allows elements to scale and adjust based on the screen size.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                    <img src="img/code1.png" alt="" >
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Media Queries</strong>
                    <p>Media queries are CSS rules that apply styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as its screen width, height, or orientation. These queries allow you to define different styles for various screen sizes.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="img/code2.png" alt="" >
                <br><br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Flexible Images and Media</strong>
                    <p>Ensure that images and media elements are responsive by setting their maximum width to 100%. This prevents images from overflowing their containers on smaller screens.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="img/code3.png" alt="" >
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mobile-First Design</strong>
                    <p>Start designing for mobile devices first and then progressively enhance the layout and features for larger screens. This ensures a better user experience on small screens and avoids overloading mobile users with unnecessary content.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
    
            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prioritize Content</strong>
                    <p>Identify and prioritize essential content and features for mobile users. Make sure that critical information is easily accessible and visible on small screens.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Test Across Devices</strong>
                    <p>Regularly test your responsive designs on various real devices and screen sizes. Emulators and browser developer tools are helpful, but nothing beats real-world testing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Performance Optimization</strong>
                    <p>Optimize your responsive website for performance. Minimize HTTP requests, use efficient image formats, and implement lazy loading for images and resources.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>Practical Implementation Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use Frameworks and Libraries</strong>
                    <p>Consider using frontend frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, or CSS Grid to streamline your responsive design process. These tools provide pre-built components and responsive grid systems.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Typography Matters</strong>
                    <p>Pay attention to typography on smaller screens. Use legible fonts, appropriate font sizes, and line spacing to ensure readability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Touch-Friendly Design</strong>
                    <p>Optimize your website for touch interactions on mobile devices. Ensure that buttons and links are large enough to tap easily, and avoid relying solely on hover effects.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
